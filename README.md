# mikrotik-gpl

Mikrotik does not publish GPL source code, specifically the Linux kernel, on its website or other downloadable place.  Instead, it requires a email request to obtain the source code.  So this repo was created to automate the process and provide it for direct download from GitHub when source is provided by Mikrotik.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress.  Hopefully Mikrotik can use a standard URL that can be used to download GPL licensed source code - without email request.

> [!TIP]
> One use of RouterOS's Linux source code, on per release basis, is a `diff` can be used as part of [tikoci/restraml's "Scheme Tools"](https://tikoci.github.io/restraml) to enable better visibility into any kernel changes, beyond just the current `/console/inspect` diff.
